# What is it?

Instagram Scraping scripts was built to collect data for our case-based research project. The script was implemented based on two main Python packages: Selenium and Instascrape. Those two open-source packages can be found on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The selenium package provides the ability to automate web browser interaction and control the browser locally or remotely. In our code, we use Selenium to do Instagram login process and search Instagram posts. The Instascrape package provides flexible API for scraping Instagram data. We used Instascrape APIs to retrieve data by different properties, such as post location and user profile. 

Anyone who is interested in using it for non-commercial research purposes is welcomed. However, we are not able to maintain or update the script to date or guarantee its functionality at any time.
